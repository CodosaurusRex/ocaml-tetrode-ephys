Renamed NeurOCaml to ocaml-tetrode-ephys.  A little less catchy, a little more descriptive, and not much chance of colliding with anyone else's project.

Renaming was pretty easy.  On github.com project page, 'Admin' tab, chose the new name.  Then on my machine, changed the name of the project directory to match the github project name, and followed stackoverflow instructions from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5686588/how-to-rename-a-repository-on-github

git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/ImAlsoGreg/ocaml-tetrode-ephys
