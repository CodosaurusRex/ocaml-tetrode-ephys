No code written yet - just thinking about what should be in the library.

Obviously I want to represent spike waveforms, and local field potential waveforms.  In the LFP case, a record can be 32kHz sampled for hours.  And there are usually 32 or 64 channels of this data recorded simultaneously.  Each recording channel has metadata.  How do I want to associate the records with the metadata (the name of the electrode that generated the data, the stereotaxic location of the electrode, filter settings, etc?)

Another major goal is to have some combination of caching or lazy evaluation, so that long stretches of data could be processed (for example, band-pass filter an LFP signal), and the relevant parts could be held in memory if they are likely to be called upon by some plotting library.

What should the format of the data look like on the disk?  I installed bin_prot and sexplib - It may make sense for me to have some general neuro_in/neuro_out types, which take both data and some options [ascii/binary], and write out a file with a short header and then the data in the chosen format.  Or maybe stick with a convention like: ascii on the disk, binary for network?
